## Challengues

While developing this project for getting a web responsive dashboard I started by searching javascript libraries wich allow to develop interactive graphs. After investigating and searching on the web
I found dc and crossfilter javascript libraries wich in combination allow to create data visualization of connected charts that offers a great experience trought interactive and responsive charts.

The second challengue was to find a way of doing the set of charts responsive, this is, I wanted the charts to render and change the size according to mobile or desktop screens. After investigating 
I found gridstack javascript library wich allow to create different widgets that adjust the size and layout depending on the screen device. 

I was very interested on ploting a map, so i found dc.leaflet wich is a javascript library in combination with dc js that works as another dc chart. The challengue is
to find a geojson to use in the map. I managed to find xml files with coordinates for the given data used, wich I parsed into a geojson having to develop a PHP script wich converted the xml into a json.
